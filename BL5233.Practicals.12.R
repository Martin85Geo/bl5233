# BL5233: Tutorial 10

# Exercise A. The data used in this exercise comprise statistical characterizations of the
# vocalizations of 234 individual birds of the species Macropygia amboinensis (the Brown 
# Cuckoo-Dove; thanks to Frank Rheindt for the data and Ryan Chisholm for the exercise). 
# The goal of the exercise is to see whether the individual birds can be separated into 
# groups based on the characteristics of their vocalizations.
